# COVID-19-Vaccine-Reporting-System
This repository contains COVID-19 Vaccination Notification System developed by Tanner Hanson during SD Hacks 2021

## Inspiration
I was inspired to create this project after seeing that there were no easily available channels to inform the general public about the availability of COVID-19 Vaccines that were about to expire. Once a vaccine has expired, it has to be thrown away. The more vaccines that are thrown away unnecessarily, the longer it will take to get a significant portion of the population vaccinated.

## What it does
This system provides a channel by which individuals can report vaccines that are about to expire to the general public. Members of the general public can view a dashboard to see if there are vaccines available near them.

## How we built it
I built this system using ArcGIS Survey123 Connect and ArcGIS Online. I created a survey using excel and ArcGIS Survey 123 Connect to create a platform where individuals can report vaccines that are available and about to expire. This survey can either be accessed from the ArcGIS Survey123 app or from the web. After I created the survey, I used ArcGIS Online to create a dashboard which shows vaccines that are about to expire. This dashboard displays the total number of vaccines reported to the medium, the number of vaccines that have not yet expired, and the locations of the available vaccinations that have yet to expire.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the largest challenges that I ran into was finding a way to create this system that matched my skill level. As a mechanical engineering student, my programming skills are not as advanced as the ability level that I would expect from many of my fellow SD Hacks participants. As such, I identified Esri's ArcGIS as a suitable platform that offers a high degree of functionality while remaining accessible to someone with limited programming experience outside of MATLAB and Arduino.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I'm proud of creating a platform that can help get the general public vaccinated sooner.

## What we learned
I learned about the importance of addressing societal problems that are currently without a solution. Additionally, I learned that it is important to identify which tool(s) is(are) available to address an identified challenge.

## What's next for COVID-19 Vaccine Notification System
I want to distribute the COVID-19 Vaccine Notification System to members of the general public to help everyone get vaccinated quicker.
